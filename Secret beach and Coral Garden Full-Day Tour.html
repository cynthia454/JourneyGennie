    <h1>Secret beach and Coral Garden Full-Day Tour</h1>
    <p>Naked island Siargao, Guyam island and Daku island will be the key highlights of this experience (as a bonus, we will visit famous Secret beach and Coral garden during the experience - if weather and the sea condition is permitted).

Naked island Philippines is is a 200m long strip of powdery white sandbank located off the southern shore of Siargao. It's a completely bare yet a picturesque place due to the surrounded views and the crystal clear water thats ideal for swimming as well. An ideal photo opportunity where there's a space for everyone on island.

We will visit Daku, a small yet breathtaking island known for white-sand beaches with beach cottages, coconut groves and seafood. You will enjoy the crystal water of the island and also we will serve a nicely presentation of picnic lunch as well. You may explore this tiny paradise at own pace.
